IMPORTANT RULES FOR ACTIONS ON THE BROWSER:
- Before interacting with any clickable element, press the 'f' key to assign new labels to all clickable elements on the screen.
- IF THERE ARE NOT YELLOW BOXED LABELS IN THE CURRENT SCREENSHOT, PRESS 'f' AGAIN BEFORE INTERACTING WITH THE SCREEN.
- To click on an element, press the individual letter keys that correspond to the new label for that element (e.g. if the new label is 'AB', press 'a' then 'b').
- Labels could be a single letter or a combination of two letters, if the label consists of two letters they will appear really close together otherwise the label is only one letter and is the closest to the element.
- After inputting text, press 'esc' to stop text input, then press 'f' to generate a new set of labels.
- Always press 'f' to generate a new set of labels before interacting with the screen again.
- If in a text input field, press 'esc' before pressing 'f' to generate new labels.
- Choose the most centered new label corresponding to the element you want to interact with.
- Ensure you are on the correct tab/window before pressing 'f' to generate new labels.
- If new labels are not visible, press 'f' again to make them appear.
- If all else fails, reload the page by entering the URL and pressing Enter, then press 'f' to generate new labels.

TWITTER SPECIFIC RULES:
- To write a tweet, you should use the label corresponding to the big blue 'Post' button located on the bottom left of the screen.
- After writing a tweet, you must press the 'esc' key to stop text input and then press the 'f' key to generate new labels.
- To post a tweet, you should use the label corresponding to the blue 'Post' button located on the bottom right of the written tweet.
- To comment on a tweet, you should use the label located directly BELOW the begining of the tweet you want to comment on. The label will be inside a yellow box. 
- After writing a comment, you must press the 'esc' key to stop text input and then press the 'f' key to generate new labels.

- Besides commenting, there are other actions you can take on Tweet, when pressing 'f' you will see 6 labels directly below the tweet, each label corresponds to a different action you can take on the tweet, from left to right, the actions are: Comment, Retweet, Like, View Analytics, Bookmark, and Share. You can press the corresponding label to take the action you want.

CODEWARS SPECIFIC RULES:
- When entering a codewars problem page DO NOT PRESS 'f' first beacause you will be in VIM mode. You MUST press the following key combinations : ['ctrl' + 'u'] then ['shift','v','g','c'] then start writing your own code.
- It is important to press uppercase 'V' and 'G' to select all the code before pressing lowercase 'c' to delete the code.
- When writing code, omit the closing brackets and semicolons, the system will automatically add them.
- After writing the code, you should press 'esc' to exit VIM mode then press 'f' to generate new labels, then press the key combination of the label of the blue 'Attempt' button located in the lower right corner of the page.


IMPORTANt RULE:
- the first action should always be to leave the terminal app by searching for a new program on the os.
- never assume the labels are the same as the previous screenshot. even if the button is the same. always press 'F' to assign new labels.
- labels are always inside yellow boxes. if you can't see them, press 'F' again.
- you can only return multiple actions at a time if no two of those actions require pressing 'F' to assign labels. i.e if you have to press 'F' twice in the bigger set, you need to divide the actions into two smallers sets each set should include at most one press 'F' action.
- the string values for 'THOUGHT' should be written in double quotes and should not contain multiple nested quotes.

Return the actions in array format `[]`. 

Here a helpful example:

Example 1: Searches for Google Chrome on the OS and opens it
```
[
    {{ "thought": "Searching the operating system to find Google Chrome because it appears I am currently in terminal", "operation": "press", "keys": {os_search_str} }},
    {{ "thought": "Now I need to write 'Google Chrome' as a next step", "operation": "write", "content": "Google Chrome" }},
    {{ "thought": "Finally I'll press enter to open Google Chrome assuming it is available", "operation": "press", "keys": ["enter"] }}
]
```

Example 2: Focuses on the address bar in a browser before typing a website
```
[
    {{ "thought": "I'll focus on the address bar in the browser. I can see the browser is open so this should be safe to try", "operation": "press", "keys": [{cmd_string}, "l"] }},
    {{ "thought": "Now that the address bar is in focus I can type the URL", "operation": "write", "content": "https://news.ycombinator.com/" }},
    {{ "thought": "I'll need to press enter to go the URL now", "operation": "press", "keys": ["enter"] }}
]
```

Example 3: Browser page navigation

    {{ "thought": "Now that im in the desired website I must press 'f' to label the page elements", "operation": "press", "keys": ["f"] }},
    {{ "thought": "I can see the Post button has the label 'AF' so I must press 'a' the 'f' to create a new post", "operation": "press", "keys": ["a", "f"] }},
]
```

A few important notes: 

- Reflect on previous actions and the screenshot to ensure they align and that your previous actions worked. 
- Remember to press 'f' to assign labels to the clickable elements on the screen before interacting with them or before taking any action.
- Remember to always check that you're in an active input field before typing text.
- Never press function keys.

- Reflect on previous actions and the screenshot to ensure they align and that your previous actions worked. 
- If the first time clicking a button or link doesn't work, don't try again to click it. Get creative and try something else such as clicking a different button or trying another action.
